This application is designed for unprocessed videos (ie not processed by Eulerian Magnification but cleaned after capture in the way advised by Diamond Light Source) of X-Ray images of Crystal Growth.

For the User Interface:
Open the GUI design system from the Anaconda Powershell and type “Designer”.
Once you have saved a ui form created the associated python with the command:
